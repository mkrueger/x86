**x86-native** is a cross-platform native Rust library for building x86 machine hosts without a browser, DOM, WebAssembly runtime or web frontend. The package name on crates.io is `x86-native`; the Rust library target remains `x86`, so applications use `use x86::...`.

> **Project status:** the native interpreter, saved-state restore, VirtIO-9P transport, host-directory filesystem, VGA framebuffer extraction and PS/2 text input are implemented and tested. The Arch saved state reaches the restored `root@localhost:~#` shell; `dump-screen` captures the guest framebuffer and `type` sends keyboard text. The project is still an incremental native device port, not a claim that every optional upstream v86 peripheral is already implemented.

## Install from Cargo

Add the package to your application:

```toml
[dependencies]
x86-native = "0.1"
```

Then import the library target as `x86`:

```rust
use x86::{Image, ImageKind, Machine, MachineConfig};

fn main() -> x86::Result<()> {
    let mut machine = Machine::new(
        MachineConfig::default().with_ram_bytes(512 * 1024 * 1024),
    );

    machine.set_disk(Image::from_file(ImageKind::RawDisk, "disk.img")?)?;
    println!("machine status: {:?}", machine.status());
    Ok(())
}
```

The package is designed for stable Rust and native targets supported by Cargo. Run `cargo add x86-native` or edit `Cargo.toml` manually as shown above.

## Features

| Feature | Default | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `remote` | yes | Native HTTP(S) resource loading through Rust networking code. It does not open a browser. |
| `zstd` | yes | Decode Zstandard-compressed saved states. |
| `--no-default-features` | no | Offline/local-only build with no remote loader and no zstd decoder. |

For a strictly offline build:

```bash
cargo build --no-default-features
```

## Main API

The `Image` type represents BIOS, VGA BIOS, raw disks, ISO images, kernels, initrds, bootloaders and memory-backed resources. It supports local file loading, SHA-256 calculation and checksum verification.

`Resource` and `Bootloader` provide a single interface for local paths, in-memory bytes and optional HTTP(S) URLs. `SavedState` validates v86-compatible state headers, metadata, buffer counts, memory size and compressed state data.

`MachineConfig` describes RAM, VGA memory, CPU frequency hints, command line and console mode. `Machine` attaches the machine resources and exposes `prepare`, `run` and `stop`. `ExecutionBackend` is a platform-neutral trait for connecting the actual native CPU/device engine.

```rust,no_run
use x86::{Bootloader, Image, ImageKind, Machine, MachineConfig, Resource, SavedState};

fn main() -> x86::Result<()> {
    let mut machine = Machine::new(
        MachineConfig::default()
            .with_ram_bytes(512 * 1024 * 1024)
            .with_command_line("rw console=ttyS0"),
    );

    machine.set_bios(Image::from_file(ImageKind::Bios, "seabios.bin")?)?;
    machine.set_vga_bios(Image::from_file(ImageKind::VgaBios, "vgabios.bin")?)?;
    machine.set_disk(Image::from_file(ImageKind::RawDisk, "disk.img")?)?;
    machine.set_saved_state(SavedState::from_file("state.bin.zst")?);
    machine.set_bootloader(Bootloader::load(Resource::url(
        "https://example.org/bootloader.bin",
    ))?);

    println!("state: {:?}", machine.status());
    Ok(())
}
```

## Native console

Native DOS text consoles expose character/attribute cells through
`Machine::vga_text_snapshot()` and the visible cursor through
`Machine::vga_text_cursor()`. `Machine::inject_scancodes()` accepts translated
PS/2 set-1 make/break bytes, including `E0` prefixes for navigation keys.
Callers should pace text and pasted input: the guest BIOS keyboard buffer is
small and can overflow when a whole command is injected at once.

The native PCI layout uses 00:00.0 for the host bridge, 00:01.0 for the ISA
bridge, 00:01.1 for legacy IDE, 00:02.0 for VGA, and 00:05.0 for VirtIO 9P.
PCI BAR mappings remain fixed; sizing probes report the supported region sizes.

Build and launch the terminal application:

```bash
cargo run --bin x86-console
```

The console is a normal native process. It does not start a web server or require a browser:

```text
x86> load bios seabios.bin
x86> load vga-bios vgabios.bin
x86> load disk disk.img
x86> load state arch_state-v3.bin.zst
x86> load bootloader https://example.org/bootloader.bin
x86> info
x86> load state ./image/arch_state-v3.bin.zst
x86> run-state 1000000
x86> dump-screen ./arch-screen.ppm
x86> type echo native-ok
x86> run-state 1000000
x86> dump-screen ./arch-screen-after-input.ppm
x86> quit
```

The native console supports two launch modes. The ordinary REPL is useful for command-driven diagnostics. The persistent TTY mode keeps the guest running continuously, switches to a portable raw terminal screen, reads keyboard events, and exits cleanly with `Esc` or `Ctrl-C`:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin x86-console -- --console --state ./image/arch_state-v3.bin.zst
```

The script mode executes deterministic host/emulator commands. A script can download a file over HTTP(S), launch an explicitly requested host process in the background, load a guest saved state, inject keyboard input, and continue guest execution:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin x86-console -- --script examples/download-and-run-server.x86
```

The example is intentionally bounded by `background 25000 2`; omit the final duration for a persistent guest loop. `wait` waits for spawned host processes, while `stop` leaves them running after the script exits. `exec` is explicit by design because it runs a host executable downloaded from the specified URL.

The ANSI renderer uses the exact VGA text plane when available. Graphical VGA states use a compact colored Unicode Braille representation, which preserves glyph shapes and avoids the horizontal banding caused by full-cell background blocks. `X86_TERM_COLS` and `X86_TERM_ROWS` override the detected terminal size. `dump-screen <path.ppm>` remains available for pixel-level framebuffer captures, and `type <text>` remains available in the REPL.

## Architecture

![x86-native architecture](docs/assets/architecture.png)

The source diagram is available as [`docs/assets/architecture.mmd`](docs/assets/architecture.mmd). The host layer is platform-neutral; platform-specific console, filesystem and networking adapters remain outside the core API. See [`examples/download-and-run-server.x86`](examples/download-and-run-server.x86) for the script DSL and [`docs/install-from-zero-ru.md`](docs/install-from-zero-ru.md) for installation commands.
